# MontyHall
A simulator of the famous Monty Hall Problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), in Python using features of the NumPy and MatplotLib libraries. 

The simulator randomises the position of the prize, and the player's pick. It automatically changes the player's answer after the empty door is revealed, and a pie chart is plotted of the result of one hundred thousand such games. The result shows that changing one's answer after the host reveals the empty door gives you a higher chance of winning the game. As the number of simulations goes higher and higher, the winning percentage should tend to exactly a 66.6% (2/3 rd)
