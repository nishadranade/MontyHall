# MontyHall
A simulator of the famous Monty Hall Problem, in Python using features of the NumPy and MatplotLib libraries. 
The simulator randomises the position of the prize, and the player's pick. It automatically changes the player's answer after the empty door is revealed, and a pie chart is plotted of one thousand such games, to represent the chance of winning by this strategy. (should ideally tend to a two thirds chance)
