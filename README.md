# MontyHall
A simulator of the famous Monty Hall Problem. The simulator randomises the position of the prize, and the player's pick. It automatically changes the player's answer after the empty door is revealed, and a pie chart is plotted of one thousand such games, to represent the chance of winning by this strategy. (should ideally tend to 666)
